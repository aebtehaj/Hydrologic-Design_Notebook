The **saturated zone** refers to sections where **pores are completely filled with water** and the pressure is **above atmospheric pressure**. This zone is typically what we think of as groundwater and follows simpler saturated flow equations. The groundwater table is where pressure in soil is equal to the atmospheric pressure.\n",

After the storm, excess water is drained by gravity from this layer when the **field capacity** is reached. The soil moisture in this region can be evaporated directly from the soil surface or through transpiration. Therefore, **this layer experiences significant diurnal and seasonal variability in moisture content**.\n",

    "- **Capillary Zone or Fringe**: The soil directly above the groundwater table where the **pores are saturated but pressure is below the atmospheric pressure at the top and equal to the atmospheric pressure at the bottom**. The negative pressure pulls up water into the pores because of an adhesion force, called capillary forces, between water molecules and soil particles. The magnitude of the **capillary force** depends on the pore size distribution and thus the soil texture. This pressure is much higher in fine grain soils (e.g., clay vs sand)."
