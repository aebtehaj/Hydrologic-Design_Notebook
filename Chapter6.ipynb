    "# 2- Basics of Surface Runoff\n",
    "\n",
    "During a rainfall event, there are two types of water storages:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Detention Storages:** Short-term storages that are depleted by overland flows and infiltration.\n",
    "- **Retention Storages:** Long-term storages that are depleted by evaporation.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**Surface runoff or overland flow** is defined as the portion of rainfall, snowmelt, and/or irrigation water that **runs over the soil surface** toward the stream network rather than infiltrating into the soil. The definition of runoff also may include the **interflow and/or return flow**, which together with the surface runoff make up the volume of **stormwater** or **total runoff**. The **return flow** is referred to the shallow subsurface lateral infiltrated flow of water that returns back to the surface.  \n",
    "\n",
    "During a precipitation event, the detention storages begin to fill out and water starts to flow over land surfaces. Overland flows join together over a hillslope and form more concentrated flows that channelize the underlying soil creating the so-called channel or **stream network**. Several channel networks eventually joint and drain into the main stream and generate the **streamflow**.\n",

    "The flow that you see in a stream or river typically consists of three main hydrologic fluxes that we briefly covered in Chapter 1. These fluxes are: **overland flow**, **return flow**, and **baseflow** as shown in the above Figure. The overland flow component can be split into two categories: \n",
    "\n",
    "- **Hortonian overland flow**: The overland flow that occurs when precipitation rate is greater than infiltration capacity.  It is also called **infiltration excess** runoff.\n",
    "- **Saturated overland flow**: The overland flow that occurs when soil becomes saturated from below due to rise in the groundwater table. The produced runoff through this mechanism is also called **saturation excess** runoff. \n",

    "\n",
    "If precipitation rate is much higher than the infiltration capacity, overland flow occurs immediately after the onset of precipitation. **Infiltration excess** is commonly observed with short-duration intense rainfall. It also occurs most often over land surfaces with high clay content or where the surface has been altered by soil compaction, urbanization, or fire.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, when precipitation rate is less than or equal to infiltration capacity, no overland surface runoff occurs. For prolonged precipitation event, the water table may rise and produce the saturated overland flow from below. It is most common with long-duration, light-to-moderate rainfall, or because of successive precipitation and or snowmelt events at upstream. Saturation excess runoff can occur anywhere, when the soil is saturated from below. It is the most common runoff generation mechanism in humid climates with gently sloped or flat basins. The saturate overland flow and return flow often occur near the stream channels, where the groundwater depth is often shallower and it rises quickly in response to infiltration -- called **groundwater ridges**.\n",
