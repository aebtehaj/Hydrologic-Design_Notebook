Convection, can take place in fluids and soft solids or mixtures where particles can move past each other due to turbulence. Turbulent diffusion is much stronger than molecular diffusion and is due to random and chaotic swirls of motions of fluid particles. When a flow is turbulent, molecular diffusion is negligible compared to the turbulent diffusion. In turbulent flows, the fluid velocity is often high and thus the trasport mechnisam is due to a mixture of advection and turbulent diffusion, which we often call convection. \n",
